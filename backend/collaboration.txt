In our team of 4, we collaborated by meeting up and designing the schema together, and in that process, we each focused on a different component (Users, Transactions, etc.). I focused on Transactions, so I designed Transaction's model in the prisma schema file, and then also built the route handlers for transaction related routes. I also helped with debugging together with the team overall.
